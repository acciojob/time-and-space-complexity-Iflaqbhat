    <h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

    <p>
        Time complexity is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the length of the input. Understanding time complexity is crucial for writing efficient algorithms that perform well even with large inputs.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory space required by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input. Space Complexity plays a significant role in determining the feasibility of an algorithm, especially in scenarios where memory is a constraint. A common notation to express space complexity is O(n), which indicates that the space required grows linearly with the size of the input.
